# Assignment 1
This is a complete python program to encrypt and decrypt classical ciphers:

-Shift Cipher

-Affine Cipher

-Vigenere Cipher

# The Program is callable from command line as follows:
◦ First argument is the cipher type [“shift”,”affine”,”vigenere”].
◦ Second argument is the operation type [“encrypt”, “decrypt”].
◦ The Third argument is the input file.
◦ The fourth argument is the output file.
◦ The last argument is the the list of encryption keys required for the cipher.(S for Shift - A,B for Affine - Key for Vigenere)
